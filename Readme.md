## Text Processor

This Go program is designed to process text files based on specific rules defined within the code. It takes an input file, applies various modifications to the text, and writes the modified text to an output file.
## Usage

To run the program, execute the following command:

bash

```go run main.go inputfile outputfile```

Replace main.go with the name of the Go source file if different, inputfile with the name of the input text file and outputfile with the desired name of the output file.
### Input File Format

The program expects the input file to contain text that needs to be processed. Each line of the input file is treated as a separate text segment.
### Output

The processed text is written to the output file, with each modified line separated by a newline character.
### Text Processing Rules

The program applies the following text processing rules to each line of text:

    Capitalization: Modifies the capitalization of words based on specific markers.
    Uppercase/Lowercase Conversion: Converts words to uppercase or lowercase based on specific markers.
    Binary/Hexadecimal Conversion: Converts binary or hexadecimal numbers to decimal.
    Determining 'a' vs. 'an': Replaces 'a' with 'an' in specific cases where grammatically appropriate.
    Apostrophe Handling: Moves apostrophes to their proper position within words.
    Punctuation Handling: Adjusts punctuation placement within words.

### Code Structure

The code consists of a main function that orchestrates the text processing operations, as well as several helper functions (caps, capno, upno, lowno, aps, punctuations) responsible for applying specific modifications to the text.
### Dependencies

The program uses the following Go standard library packages:

    bufio: For buffered I/O operations.
    fmt: For formatted I/O.
    os: For operating system-specific functionality.
    strconv: For string conversions.
    strings: For string manipulation.
